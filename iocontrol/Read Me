Sample of communication using semaphores and IOCTL.

To test this sample, please follow commands bellow:

Please use two terminals to run this sample.

To compile use the command:

$ make

After that you'll need to install the kernel object using:

$ sudo insmod iocontroldevice.ko

Now you'll be able to test the program.

Open the second terminal and split your screen between both. Type the following command in both of your terminals:

$ ./test

When you're ready press enter quickly in one after the other.

You should see both terminals trying to write numbers. Each one will write 1.000.000 times, when the program stop the final number should be 2.000.000.

After you're done, use the command:

$ sudo rmmod iocontroldevice

and also:

$ make clean

to remove the kernel object and clean the other files.
