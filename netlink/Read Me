This is a simple netlink sample

To compile use the command:

$ Make

After that you'll need to install the kernel object using:

$ sudo insmod netLinkKernel.ko

Now you'll be able to test the program.

Use the command:

$ ./test

to start the program.

after you type your message, you can verify that the kernel received it through:

$ dmesg
